## WTF?
A simple arduino sequenzer to control a 8 channel relay shield. It supports multiple patterns which are randomly choosen.
Each pattern consits of a loop rate, a sleep time and the sequence data. Each bit of the data represents one channel.

Any negative number will be replaced by a positive random value within the range of given boarders.


Have Fun!
